# Vectors Server

This project aims to implement the Server component of Vectors (Video communication through opportunistic relays and scalable video coding) is a Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs), a research project developed at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.

This project aims to record and create SHVC encoded video. SHVC is a special type of video compression algorithm which splits a video into multiple temporal and spatial layers. While the base video layers are necessarily required for playing the video, the higher layers are only required for increasing the video quality. These files are then transferred on the DTN.
